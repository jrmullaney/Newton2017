List the main objectives of the proposed research in order of priority
1. Train Thai graduate students in the handling of very large datasets, and in particular the automated analysis of that data. On completion of the project, the students will possess a range of high-level skills that will be readily transferrable to sectors that are well-positioned to help Thailand transition from a middle to upper-income economy.

2. Establish a data centre within Thailand to store, organise and analyse data produced by the Gravitational-wav Optical Transient Observatory GOTO. As well as being an important research asset for NARIT capable of feeding through to their other facilities for (semi-) automated follow-up observations, the data centre will be a valuable “Big Data” training resource for the broader Thai research community.

3. Hold a series of 5-day practical workshops during which we will use a cloud-based representation of the data centre (to avoid issues surrounding security and data access rights) as a training resource to teach NARIT and other Thai staff and students Big Data handling techniques. These workshops will be attended by up to 30 trainees and will cover database management and the basics of Machine Learning-based analyses.  

Describe the proposed research in simple terms in a way that could be publicised to a general audience.
The most effective way of reducing levels of poverty in developing countries is through their continued economic development, which leads to increased levels of income per person. To remain competitive, however, a developing economy needs access to a workforce with increasingly sophisticated skills. For Thailand today, this means skills that enable innovation, allowing it to compete against other developing and developed economies. With more and more sectors collecting data on their customers, production lines, distribution networks, stock prices, etc.,  one of the most crucially needed "high-level" skills is the ability to handle large amounts of digital data. However, as present, Thai students lack ready access to very large datasets, which prevents their training in this area. Our project addresses this problem by combining the resources and experience of UK astronomers of very large datasets, with the skills of Thai Data Scientists in digital data analysis. Through this collaboration, the Thai students will gain access to a vast amounts of digital data in the form of astronomical surveys. Working under the supervision of the Thai and UK partners, the students will establish a data centre in Thailand that will store and automatically analyse this data. In doing so, the students gain important experience in handling vast amounts of digital data, while also providing an important research and training asset for Thai astronomers and other scientists. Furthermore, the software resulting from the students' research will form an important component of the pipeline used to process data from a new telescope being developed by UK astronomers, and will thus directly benefit UK science. On completion of the project, the skills acquired by the Thai students will be readily transferrable to a diverse range of economic sectors such as information technology, medicine, finance, security, etc., thereby helping the further economic development of Thailand.

Impact Summary:

Beneficiaries:
The immediate beneficiaries of this research will be the Thai graduate students who will receive training in high-level data handling skills while conducting their research project. Following the project, these students will be able to apply these skills within a diverse range of growth sectors, such as finance, medicine, logistics, information technology etc. In doing so, they will benefit the wider Thai economy by helping grow and compete internationally through innovation.

Secondary beneficiaries will be the scientists and astronomers who are involved in GOTO - of which NARIT is a contributing member. By establishing a data centre to host and automatically analyse large amounts of digital data, the outcome of the students' research will play an important role in extracting information from the vast amounts of data that GOTO will provide. This information can then be fed through to other NARIT facilities for follow-up observations, including by their network of Robotic Telescopes within outreach centres across Thailand. This provides the means to raise awareness amongst students, schoolchildren and the general public of the impact that Big Data can have on scientific research.
